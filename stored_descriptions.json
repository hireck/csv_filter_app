{"data sample.csv":{"reduced_file":"data/sample_data_informative", "description":"This dataset represents transactional e-commerce records from **NordCub**, an online store specializing in **outdoor and functional apparel** (such as UV-protection sets, shell jackets, and reflective accessories). It contains **22,495 individual line items** across **13,557 orders** and **8,265 customers**, covering activity between August and December 2025 in Denmark (with sales recorded in Aarhus and Copenhagen). Each row corresponds to a single purchased product, with detailed identifiers (`product_id`, `sku`, `variant_id`) and links to customer profiles and order IDs. Monetary amounts are in Euros.  \n The data is highly structured, with standardized financial metrics (`gross_sales`, `net_sales`, `total_sales`, `cost_of_goods_sold`, `gross_profit`) reflecting just six consistent price points, indicating a well-defined product catalog. Marketing attribution is partially captured via `utm_source` and `utm_medium` (mostly Google CPC and Facebook paid social), while most operational variables (e.g., `order_confirmed`, `fully_paid`, `shipping_description`) are uniform, representing clean, finalized transactions. This makes the dataset particularly suitable for analyzing **sales performance, product mix, profitability, customer retention, and marketing channel effectiveness** in the context of a lifestyle and outdoor apparel retailer."}}
